    st.write("The S&P 500 is perhaps the world‚Äôs most well-known stock index. The index contains about 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., making it a bellwether for stocks. It includes stocks across all 11 sectors of the economy, as defined by the GICS classification system.")
    st.write("According to Standard & Poor‚Äôs, the index represents about 80 percent of the total value of all stocks trading in the U.S. markets. And the index is synonymous with the market as a whole. When people ask ‚Äúhow the market did today,‚Äù they‚Äôre often referring specifically to the S&P 500.")
    st.write("Tens of trillions of dollars are invested in the companies in the index, and investors can own those companies directly or buy a fund tracking the whole index. If they buy an index fund, they‚Äôll get immediate diversified exposure to the hundreds of companies contained in the index.")
    st.write("For a company, it‚Äôs quite valuable to be included in the index. When a new firm is added to the S&P 500, all the funds tracking the index must rebalance their holdings. They‚Äôll have to go into the market and buy the new stock joining the index and sell the old one leaving it. And when net new money is added to an S&P 500 index fund, the fund company must buy the stocks in it.")
    st.write("All that buying helps keep the stocks in the S&P 500 running high. A strong stock price makes it cheaper for a company to raise money by issuing new shares and generally makes the firm more attractive.

Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that medical device company Insulet (PODD) would replace SVB Financial Group in the S&P 500. The change was set to take effect March 15, 2023.")

    st.write("Those are the most important criteria for inclusion, but Standard & Poor‚Äôs also considers how the inclusion of a stock maintains a balance of sectors for the index as a whole. Index managers want a collection of companies that give a representative picture of major American businesses.")

    st.write("The S&P 500 is an index that‚Äôs weighted according to the size of the companies in the index. The larger the company, the more heft it carries. The weightings rely on each firm‚Äôs market capitalization ‚Äì the total value of its outstanding shares. A larger firm carries a larger weighting in the index, though Standard & Poor‚Äôs makes some adjustments based on how much of the stock is actually traded (‚Äúfloated‚Äù) in the market (versus how much is held off the market.)")
    st.write("The price of the S&P 500 index that you see quoted ‚Äì for example, 4,301.56 ‚Äì is measured in points, not dollars. That‚Äôs the weighted average value of all the index‚Äôs components. As the component stocks move up or down, the index rises or falls according to the calculation.")
